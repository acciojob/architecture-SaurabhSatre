                    <h2>Living Area Design</h2>
                    <p>When designing living areas, consider both functionality and aesthetics. The living room should accommodate furniture arrangements that promote conversation while allowing for traffic flow. Key principles include maintaining proper clearances (typically 36 inches for main walkways), creating focal points like fireplaces or large windows, and ensuring adequate lighting with a mix of ambient, task, and accent lighting.</p>
                    <p>Dining rooms should allow at least 36 inches between the table edge and walls or furniture for comfortable seating and movement. Entryways and foyers should provide a welcoming transition space with room for greeting guests and storing outerwear.</p>

                    <h2>Service Area Design</h2>
                    <p>The kitchen is the heart of the home's service area and should follow the work triangle principle (sink, refrigerator, and stove forming an efficient triangle with sides between 4-9 feet). Include adequate counter space (at least 158 inches total), proper appliance placement, and storage solutions that minimize unnecessary movement.</p>
                    <p>Bathrooms should be designed with clear floor space (minimum 30x30 inches in front of fixtures), proper ventilation, and durable materials. Bedrooms require consideration of furniture placement, with closets typically 24 inches deep and allowing for adequate circulation space around beds (minimum 22 inches on sides, 36 inches at foot).</p>
